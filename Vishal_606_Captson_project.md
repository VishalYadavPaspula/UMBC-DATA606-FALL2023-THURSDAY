# ACADEMIC PROJECTS
#### 1. FUEL CONSUMPTION - MACHINE LEARNING
Link to the project - https://drive.google.com/file/d/15CpYnTJwHTfJ_A2ExLT9g-pebX8By7DG/view?usp=sharing
I conducted a comprehensive analysis on a fuel consumption dataset to predict vehicle miles per gallon (mpg) using various regression techniques. After preprocessing the data to retain only numerical values, I explored methods like Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Regression Trees. Employing best practices, I performed hyperparameter selection, cross-validation, and regularization to ensure accurate predictions. The goal was to achieve optimal mpg prediction while comparing and contrasting the effectiveness of different models.
#### 2. BIG DATA - SHIPPING ROUTE OPTIMIZATION

Developed and implemented an efficient shipping route optimization strategy for minimizing fuel consumption, encompassing multiple cities across the US. Leveraged geographical data and routing algorithms to design an optimal journey that commences and concludes in Dallas, TX. Successfully navigated through key cities including New York City, Washington DC, Miami, and Seattle, employing advanced logistics techniques. The achieved solution significantly contributed to cost savings and operational efficiency in the transportation process.
